def subsetsWithUniqueSumTotal(nums: Set[int], k: int) -> int:
    """
    Given a set of integers nums, finds the sum of all integers for
    which there is exactly one subset of nums with size k whose sum
    is equal to that integer.

    Args:
        Required positional:
        nums (set of ints): The set of integers of interest. Note
                that this cannot contain repeated elements.
        k (int): The size of the subsets of nums for which an integer
                included in the sum can be the sum of exactly one
                of these subsets.
    
    Returns:
    Integer (int) giving the sum of all integers for which there is
    exactly one subset of nums with size k whose sum is equal to that
    integer.

    Outline of rationale:
    This is solved using bottom up dynamic programming, for integer m
    increasing from 0 to n finding the subset sums including the first m
    elements of the set, by adding the m:th element of nums to the
    possible subset sums including the first (m - 1) elements (i.e.
    the result of the previous step), keeping track of the number of
    included elements (capping this at k) and whether that sum for that
    number of included elements can be achieved in more than one way.
    This is optimised for k > len(nums) / 2 by noting that if an integer
    a is a unique sum among subsets of size k, then as its complement,
    (sum(nums) - a) is a unique sum among subsets of size (len(nums) - k).
    We can additionally save space by noting that sums of sets including
    more elements cannot by inserting further elements affect the sums
    of sets including fewer elements. This allows us to maintain a single
    structure with the results, taking care when adding a new element
    to iterate over the structure in decreasing order of number of
    included elements.
    Furthermore, for the final elements added, we need only focus on
    those subsets that have a number of elements that stand a chance
    of reaching the required number of elements (so those for which,
    even if all the rest of the elements to be inserted are included
    would still result in fewer than the required number of elements
    can be ignored).
